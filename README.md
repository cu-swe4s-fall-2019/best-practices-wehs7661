# Best Practices

## Description
This is a repository for Assignment 1 of the course Software Engineering for Scientist (CSCI7000) at CU Boulder, which includes the following files:
- `get_column_stats.py`: a Python code which takes in a tab-separated file of integer and print out the mean and the standard deviation of the data 
- `basics_test.sh`: a shell script for functional testing of `get_column_stats.py`
- `basics_test.py`: a python script for unit test of `get_column_stats.py`
- `style.py`: a Python code for praticing PEP8 coding style
- `data.txt`: a data file generated by `basics_test.sh` automatically 

## Usage
The user can follow the synopsis below to run `get_column_stats.py` to calculate the mean and the standard deviation of a given tab-separated file of integers:
```
python get_column_stats.py -f [file_name] -c [column_number]
```
To run function testing for `get_column_stats.py`, simply run:
```
bash basics_test.sh
```
To run unit testing for `get_column_stats.py`, simply run:
```
python basics_test.py
```

## Changes made upon the starter code of Assignment 1
- Fixed style issues in â€‹`style.py`
- Modified the structure of `get_column_stats.py` by grouping part of the code into a newly defined function: `column_stats`.
- Made sure that `get_column_stats.py` conforms to the best practices, including PEP8 coding style, exceptions handling, docstring for each function and the utilization of main function and the argparse module.
- Wrote functional testing for `get_column_stats.py` in `basics_test.sh`
    - Testing for PEP8 coding style
    - Test if `get_column_stats.py` works properly with random numbers
    - Test if `get_column_stats.py` works properly (compare to known expected behavior)
    - Test if the exceptions handling in `get_column_stats.py` works properly

## Changes made in Assignment 2 (with Assignment 1 as the starter code)
- The parser used in get_column_stats.py was slightly changed to make it easier to be tested.
- `basics_test.py` was created to do unit tests upon `get_column_stats.py`. The following unit tests are done:
  - Test if the method `column_stats` in `get_column_stats.py` works properly with a list of constants.
  - Test if the method `column_stats` in `get_column_stats.py` works properly with a list of random numbers.
  - Test if exceptions in `get_column_stats.py` are handled properly.
  - Test if the parser in `get_column_stats.py` works properly.
- `.travis.yml` was modified to run the tests and ensure that required packages will be install when CI is performed.
